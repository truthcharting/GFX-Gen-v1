- Font sizes and families
- Button styles and animations
- Layout and spacing

### 3D Settings
Modify the 3D rendering settings in `app.js`:
- Camera field of view
- Lighting setup
- Texture quality
- Animation duration

## üîß Development

### Local Development
1. Clone or download the files
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Use a local server for PWA features:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .
   ```

### Building for Production
The app is already optimized for production. For deployment:
